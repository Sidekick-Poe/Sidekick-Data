TutorialPanelSkillGemTitle,Skill Gems I: The Basics,,,3582738807,
TutorialPanelSkillGemContent1,"				
In Path of Exile, all of your skills (other than your default attack) come from items called 'skill gems'. Skill gems must be socketed into your equipped weapons and armour in order for you to be able to use the skill they grant. It doesn't matter which item the gem is socketed into, but the socket has to match the colour of the gem. In other words, red skill gems can go in red sockets, and can't go in blue or green sockets.

Support gems work very similarly to skill gems, except they don't grant you a skill by themselves. Instead, support gems can augment the skill gems they are linked to. Not all skill and support gems work together; You can't use a 'Melee Physical Damage Support' with a spell, for example.",,,2517158061,
TutorialPanelSkillGemContent2,"
For a support gem to properly augment a skill gem, both the skill and support gems must be socketed in linked sockets. If they aren't linked, the support will have no effect.

You can tell whether or not your support gem is affecting your skill gem by looking at the on-screen skill icon. Properly linked support gems add a little letter to the skill icon on the user interface. Most support gems also change the mana cost of the skills they're supporting.",,,2060827242,
TutorialPanelSkillGemContent3,"You can add or remove your skill and support gems at any time, so don't be afraid to experiment with strange gem combinations.",,,4263088614,

TutorialPanelSupportGemSubtitle2,Triggerable Supports:,,,2816710447,
TutorialPanelSupportGemContent1,"Support and skill gems, like other items, have level and attribute requirements. Unlike other items, gems can level up, and when a gem levels up, its level and attribute requirements can change. If you level a gem past the point that you can use it, or if your attributes change and disable a gem, the entire item the gem is socketed in will also be disabled. That means it's worth checking whether or not you should level up gems that don't require your primary attributes. Sometimes it's better not to level up a gem!",,,4266614169,
TutorialPanelSupportGemContent2,You may find that you want to use the same support gem for multiple skills. Simply socket that support in the same item as the skills you wish to support and make sure they are all linked. The support gem doesn't have to be adjacent to the skill gems you want to support; they just have to all be part of the same group of linked sockets. You may also find that you want the same skill to be supported by multiple support gems. The requirements for this are the same.,,,4198188585,
TutorialPanelSupportGemContent3,"Some support gems will significantly change the way the supported skills behave. A spell supported by the 'Spell Totem' support will now summon a totem to cast the spell for you, and you won't be able to cast the spell yourself. The same is true for the 'Trap' support and the two Mine supports, 'High-Impact Mine' and 'Blastchain Mine.'",,,332712509,
TutorialPanelSupportGemContent4,"Some support gems can be used to trigger a skill automatically. The 'Cast on Critical Strike Support' gem casts the spells it is supporting whenever you get a critical strike with an attack it is also supporting. Any spell supported this way can only be triggered and can no longer be cast manually, similar to how the Spell Totem Support works. Skills being supported by multiple trigger gems won't work at all. Keep this in mind when deciding which skills and supports you want to use.",,,610088534,

TutorialPanelPassiveSkillTreeSubtitle2,Planning and Changing Your Build:,,,3729569388,
TutorialPanelPassiveSkillTreeContent1,"Your character build is primarily composed of the items the character is wearing, the skill and support gems that are socketed within those items, and the passive skills you have chosen from the passive skill tree. Because the passive skill tree lays the groundwork for your items and gems, the passive skill tree is arguably the core of every character build. 

Whenever you level up, and upon completing certain quests, you'll get a passive skill point. Each point can be allocated on the passive skill tree to gain the benefits of the passive skill (often referred to as a 'passive') it is spent on.

You can only allocate points on passives that are connected to your other allocated passives. There are far, far more passive skills on the tree than you can ever allocate, so you need to think carefully about what you want to choose. It is often worth planning ahead.

There are three types of passive skill:",,,1950660283,
TutorialPanelPassiveSkillTreeContent2,"Many clusters on the passive tree have 'Masteries' at their centres which signify the type of passives that cluster grants. Allocating any Notable in a cluster with a Mastery grants access to the 'Mastery passive.' Mastery passives provide a selection of one of many special stats related to the Mastery theme (e.g. Fire or Bow). Like regular passives, Masteries require a passive point to allocate. Mastery passives are shared across the tree, so Fire Masteries everywhere give the same selection of special stats. Special stats cannot be allocated more than once.",,,1515546507,
TutorialPanelPassiveSkillTreeContent3,"The passive skill tree also contains jewel sockets. An allocated jewel socket can hold a jewel, but won't grant any sort of benefit by itself. Jewels cannot interact with Masteries.",,,1517459170,
TutorialPanelPassiveSkillTreeContent4,"The tree is shared by all of the character classes, but each class begins in a different location. Learning what is near each starting location will help you plan out future characters.

You can undo your choices with the passive refund points you get from certain quests and from using Orbs of Regret. You can only undo a single point per refund point, so if you plan on making changes later, make sure you can afford to do so.

TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent1,"Your Path of Exile character is primarily built from a combination of passive skills, skill gems, and items. Both the passive tree and the items can seem overwhelming at first, so in this tutorial we will cover some of the basics.",,,448757107,
TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent2,"The most important thing to know is how the passive tree interacts with your character. In general, passive skills affect all the relevant stats on your character, regardless of where they come from. We call these global modifiers.",,,3995510539,
TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent3,"In the example above, we see that the 'increased maximum life' passives add together before they affect the character's life. Most passive skills, especially any that use the word 'increased', act this way.",,,1686474091,
TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent4,"Passives that specifically say they grant 'more' or 'less' of something are the exceptions to the above rule. These are applied after all of the increases, acting like multipliers. Unlike passives which increase something, passives which provide 'more' or 'less' of something never add together and instead each apply their multiplicative effect separately. These terms appear on Keystones in the passive skill tree, but are most commonly seen on support gems.",,,3486327830,
TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent5,"Item mods tend to come in two varieties: 'global mods', which act like the passive skills, and 'local mods', which affect the item itself. Compare the weapons below, and note that the magic weapon (on the right) has 'Increased Physical Damage'. You'll see that the weapon's Physical Damage is higher, and is a different colour. It is this number that is used when other modifiers, such as your passive skills, are used to calculate how much damage your attacks deal.",,,3926861555,
TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent6,"The same is true for increases to armour on items that naturally provide armour, or increases to evasion on items that naturally provide evasion, and so on.  
			
Some mods, such as 'Increased Attack Speed', can appear on both weapons and armour. Like the Increased Physical Damage modifier, the Increased Attack Speed on the weapon shown below is local to the weapon, and changes that specific weapon's rate of attack. The gloves shown below also have Increased Attack Speed, but they affect any weapon you are holding and use the Attacks Per Second value displayed on the weapon to calculate how quickly you attack.",,,3491693077,
TutorialPanelStatsAndModsCalculationsContent7,"The attack speed mod on these gloves is a global modifier, so it adds together with other global increases to attack speed, including those on your passive tree.
 
As a general rule (though there are occasional exceptions), if the values in the top section of an item are different to the normal basetype, they are benefitting from local modifiers. If a modifier on an item doesn't seem to be affecting anything in the top section, then it is global.

Figure out how you plan to deliver damage and look for items that amplify that. If you plan to shoot arrows at monsters from afar, a high-damage bow, as well as passive skills that benefit your chosen weapon, are a must. 

If you plan to cast spells, look for weapons with 'increased Spell Damage'. If you're strictly dealing fire damage, look for things that boost your fire damage. A fire spell like Fireball benefits from increases to fire, spell, and projectile damage. A character who wants to smash things with a one-handed mace should look for modifiers to one-handed weapons, maces, attacks and melee attacks specifically.",,,912582188,

Sources of life and increases to it are a great way to extend your lifespan, but you'll also want to seek out ways to mitigate the damage before it ever touches your life pool. 

Fire damage, such as the fire from a cannibal's thrown torch, can be mitigated by sources of 'Fire Resistance'. Merveil's spells deal cold damage, so 'Cold Resistance' is very useful against her. If a certain spell or attack deals significantly more damage to you than anything else, it might be of an element that you don't have much resistance to. If you're ever unsure where you spend your next passive point, it's almost always worth investing in a relevant defence.",,,2786120574,

Like other items, maps can be normal, magic, rare or unique, and have a wide pool of mods that affect both the difficulty and reward of the areas they open.

Want something more structured? You can duel individual players, or form a team and fight as a group. Path of Exile also supports a Capture the Flag game mode.

There are two main PvP brackets -- Open PvP, which has no limits on player level, and Low Level Dueling (LLD) which is limited to players of level 28 or below.

Leo Redmane in the Sarn Encampment offers daily PvP missions, and rewards active PvPers with Hideout decorations and crafting options, similar to other Forsaken Masters.

Dying in a PvP area on a Hardcore league does not send you to Standard, but if you die to another player outside of a PvP area, such as during the Act 2 Bandit questline, you will be sent to Standard as normal.

Note that special damage scaling rules are in place for PvP to level the playing field to some degree. Even so, the difference in both player skill and gear can be extreme, so don't become discouraged if you get slaughtered on your first try.",,,2854456417,

TutorialPanelHideoutContent1,"Once you have rescued Helena from the Chamber of Sins in Act 2, she will offer you a quest to claim and populate a Hideout. Your Hideout is your own private space, and is shared by all of the characters on your account, regardless of league (though access to certain things within your Hideout is still restricted by league). It comes with a stash, a guild stash if you're in a guild, a waypoint, and a crafting bench. 

The crafting bench comes with several basic recipes by default, but many more can be unlocked as you journey through the campaign and participate in side content such as the Azurite Mine and the Eternal Labyrinth. Typically an item may only have one crafted mod at a time, but any existing crafted mod can be replaced via the Crafting Bench for a small additional cost.

You can also invite the masters to your Hideout. There are currently 5 masters -- Einhar, Niko, Alva, Jun and Zana -- although you can invite Helena and Navali to your Hideout as well. Each master has a gameplay mechanic associated with them, such as capturing beasts for Einhar.",,,4248641561,
TutorialPanelHideoutContent2,"Besides the functional objects within your Hideout, you can place hundreds of special Hideout decorations. Some of these come with your Hideout, but many more can be purchased with Favour, a resource earned by helping masters like Einhar and Niko. Each master has their own Hideout decorations they can sell, though what is available is limited by the master's decoration level. Each master has a different requirement for raising their decoration level. You can see the requirement by hovering over their level when talking to them. 

Your Hideout, the masters within it, and all your decorations, both placed and stored, are all shared across all leagues. That means your Hideout will be the same on Standard as it is in a challenge league. The recipes available on your Hideouts crafting bench are not, and must be rediscovered in temporary leagues.",,,833516964,

The Menagerie has a small arena with a stone plate, called the Blood Altar. At the Blood Altar you can perform 'Beastcrafting'. This requires that you select a recipe for which you have the required beasts. Once selected, those beasts will attack you in the arena. Successfully defeating those beasts will complete the craft, while death will result in those beasts escaping (and, if you're in a Hardcore league, your character transferring to Standard). 

Recipes can be discovered by capturing beasts, so be sure to capture a wide range of beasts!

Although Strongboxes are not technically items, they do share some special traits in common with many of Path of Exile's items. Specifically, Strongboxes have mods and, like items, these mods can be changed with the use of currency.

TutorialPanelFlasksContent2,"Flasks in Path of Exile are not consumable items. Unlike Scrolls of Wisdom, when you use a Flask, it does not vanish. Instead, it simply consumes a number of flask charges based on the flask you're using, and, once empty, must be refilled before it can be used again. Flasks can come in normal, magic or unique rarity, but not rare. 

Usually, flasks refill as you slay monsters. This means as long as you're successfully engaging in combat, you should always have a flask or two available for use. But if you get into a spot of trouble and empty your flasks, you'll either have to carefully slay enough monsters to refill them or return to Town. 

Your flasks also refill when you return to Town, so jumping into a portal is a valid strategy when you're running low on flask charges. Some flasks, such as those with the 'Surgeon's' prefix, can be refilled based on other conditions.",,,4134014755,
TutorialPanelFlasksContent3,"Other magic mods can enhance the amount of life or mana a flask restores, or the duration it lasts, or the number of times it can be used. Some also provide extra utilities, such as removing curses or ailments. 

Carefully selecting your flasks and which mods they have is just as important as selecting which weapon to wield or passive skills to take. If ever you are struggling to survive, take a look at your flasks and see if improvements can be made. They are often a cheap and effective place to start solving character build problems.",,,3076171215,

TutorialPanelIncursionContent1,"Once you have reached Act 7, you may encounter Alva Valai. Alva is trying to find the location of the lost treasure temple of Atzoatl using ancient Waystones that begin appearing from the Causeway onwards. With her help, you will travel back in time two thousand years, to the Temple of Atzoatl during its construction. During this time, you can help influence the temple's construction, so that when you eventually find it, it is filled with glorious treasure.

You'll only have a limited amount of time during this visit to influence the layout of Atzoatl in the present day, but this time can be extended by slaying its inhabitants. Enemies will not drop loot during your Incursions, but once the timer runs out, you'll be returned to the present-day and showered with loot based on how well you did.

There are two primary objectives to pursue during your incursion: Architects and Altars of Passage.",,,2613279259,
TutorialPanelIncursionContent2,"Each chamber in Atzoatl has several walls which could potentially allow it to connect to another chamber. Some of these may already be connected, but many won't. If, during your Incursion, an enemy drops a Stone of Passage, you can pick it up and place it in an Altar of Passage, and it will connect the chamber you are in to an adjacent one.

This is important, because when you visit the Temple of Atzoatl during the present day, you may only be able to reach the chambers you managed to connect in the past!",,,3334981928,
TutorialPanelIncursionContent3,"Within each Incursion you can find two Vaal Architects. By slaying one, you will allow the other to escape and later develop that chamber in their own vision. If the surviving Architect had previously influenced the development of that room, that room will then be upgraded. If not, then that room will change to something within their realm of expertise.

For example, if you land in the Banquet Hall during an incursion and slay the Architect of Fortifications, allowing the Architect of Toxins to survive, the Banquet Hall will become the Poison Garden. If in a later Incursion you land in the Poison Garden and kill the Architect of Iron, again allowing the Architect of Toxins survive, it will be upgraded to the Cultivar Chamber.",,,2762099723,
TutorialPanelIncursionContent4,"The types and tiers of the rooms you help engineer through your Incursions ultimately form the Temple of Atzoatl in the present day. 

Each room has a different effect. Some are purely positive, while others may put you at significant risk for valuable rewards. By upgrading the Cultivar Chamber to the Toxic Grove, for example, you will fill the Temple of Atzoatl with dangerously poisonous plants, but you will also give yourself the opportunity to loot a unique item that can be found nowhere else.",,,2849258442,
TutorialPanelIncursionContent5,"Once you've performed enough Incursions, Alva will discover the location of Atzoatl, and will offer you the opportunity to go there. At long last, you can explore the temple you helped create, and loot it for all it's worth! 

After you've visited the temple in the present-day, the next time you find Alva in the world, she will offer you the opportunity to start your Incursions all over again, with a new temple layout and with new opportunities to maximise your rewards.",,,3128992442,
TutorialPanelIncursionContent6,"The Incursion league includes a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Incursion Bandana. At 24, you will receive the Incursion Cloak. When you complete your 36th challenge, you will receive the Incursion Portal Effect. These cosmetic effects are only obtainable in this league. 

From the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Incursion Totem Pole decoration to display in your Hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Incursion challenges you completed during the league.",,,3381813738,

TutorialPanelDelveContent1,"Once you have broken the seal in Highgate and gained access to the mines below, you will begin to encounter veins of Voltaxic Sulphite throughout the world. When you interact with these Voltaxic Sulphite veins, a character called Niko will appear to mine it out of the ground for you. 

Niko operates a mine that was previously abandoned by the Eternal Empire, and wants your help obtaining enough Sulphite to help illuminate the mine. Once you have some Sulphite, you can visit his mine. There are three points of interest at the mine: Niko himself, the Subterranean Chart, and the Generator.",,,1261433178,
TutorialPanelDelveContent2,"To access the mine itself, you need to use the Subterranean Chart device and select the point within the mine you wish to visit. Once there, you will appear next to a mobile machine called Crawler, which is powered by the Voltaxic Sulphite you have collected throughout the world. Use Crawler to select which adjacent area within the mine you would like to explore, and it will start moving in that direction. Be aware that this consumes some amount of Voltaxic Sulphite. 

Along the way to your destination you will encounter monsters and other paths into the dark depths of the mine, and at your destination you may find a difficult fight! Be careful when straying too far from Crawler, because the darkness in this mine is no ordinary darkness!",,,3269403069,
TutorialPanelDelveContent3,"The darkness in this mine obscures your vision, but it also deals you damage. The damage grows the longer you stay in the darkness, so while short visits into the darkness might be OK, you won't be able to stay in there for long periods.

The monsters within the mine are also empowered by the darkness, and will take massively reduced damage while they dwell within it. Some of the monsters will even use the darkness as a weapon, shutting down nearby lights. But don't worry, you can create some weapons of your own!",,,1755154155,
TutorialPanelDelveContent4,"With the Azurite you find in the mine you can craft and upgrade flares and dynamite.

Flares are portable light sources that can be thrown to specific locations and last for a short while. You won't get very far through the mine by just throwing flares -- you need Crawler's help for that -- but you can use them to explore areas near your pre-lit paths for valuable treasures.

Dynamite won't provide any light, but can be used to harm enemies and open up new paths. You'll encounter Fractured Walls throughout the mine that can be destroyed with a well-placed stick of dynamite.  Both of these items can be upgraded at the Generator, improving their effectiveness as well as the amount of each that you can carry. It's worth carrying a few on your character when you want to go treasure-hunting in the dark.","With the Azurite you find in the mine you can craft and upgrade flares and dynamite. These can only be used within the Azurite Mine, and need to be bound to buttons like a skill.

Flares are portable light sources that can be thrown to specific locations and last for a short while. You won't get very far through the mine by just throwing flares -- you need Crawler's help for that -- but you can use them to explore areas near your pre-lit paths for valuable treasures.

Dynamite won't provide any light, but can be used to harm enemies and open up new paths. You'll encounter Fractured Walls throughout the mine that can be destroyed with a well-placed stick of dynamite.  Both of these items can be upgraded at the Generator, improving their effectiveness as well as the amount of each that you can carry. It's worth carrying a few on your character when you want to go treasure-hunting in the dark.",,1554011333,
TutorialPanelDelveContent5,"While it's fun to explore and slay monsters, the main reason you'll want to explore the Azurite Mine is for the Resonators. Resonators are special crafting items with sockets. They act like Chaos Orbs and come in several different sizes. To use one, you need to find Fossils to socket into them.

It's the Fossils that set Resonators apart from their currency counterparts. Each Fossil socketed into a Resonator in some way influences what the outcome will be when that Resonator is used on an item. See below for an example.",,,1961248216,
TutorialPanelDelveContent6,"The Delve league includes a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Canary pet. At 24, you will receive the Azurite Back Attachment. When you complete your 36th challenge, you will receive the Delve Portal. These cosmetic effects are only obtainable in this league. 

From the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Delve Totem Pole decoration to display in your Hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Delve challenges you completed during the league.",,,4253278526,

TutorialPanelMappingContent5,"You may soon find strange patterns on your Atlas, such as swirling tentacles or glittering stars. These are indicators of whose influence those maps are under. Maps concealed by tentacles are under the influence of an entity called The Elder, while maps masked by stars are under the influence of The Shaper.

Each of these entities augment the maps they are influencing, either by adding extra monsters or making the boss fights more difficult. Completing a map that is influenced by one of these entities will remove the influence and may cause the other entity to influence that map instead.",,,4007853893,
TutorialPanelMappingContent6,"Completing other maps may also grow an entity's influence, though since the Shaper and Elder are at war with each other, you may not always get the outcome you want. If you want to grow The Elder's influence, your best bet may be to target Shaper-influenced areas or areas with no influence at all.

As The Elder's influence grows, you may find that several maps become inhabited by The Elder's guardians. Completing these maps involves tough boss encounters, but if you manage to do it, they may lead to The Elder itself.

Monsters in Shaper- or Elder-influenced maps can drop special versions of items that are also Elder- or Shaper-influenced. These items can roll special (and often very powerful) mods that are not ordinarily available.",,,3581819596,

TutorialPanelAtlasObjectivesContent1,"When viewing your Atlas you may notice that some maps have large symbols around them. These are Atlas Objectives. Each objective signifies that opening and entering that map will guarantee an encounter with one of the masters.

Each symbol represents the presence of a specific master:",,,2638904576,
TutorialPanelAtlasObjectivesContent2,"This special property is unique to your Atlas -- a party member can't benefit from the objectives on your Atlas.

The objectives are consumed as soon as you open the associated map. New objectives are guaranteed to appear once a day, but you also have a chance to generate a new objective whenever you complete a map.

New objectives select maps based on the tier of your last completed map, within two tiers. In other words, if you complete a tier 10 map, a new objective may appear on a tier 9, 10 or 11 map. The exceptions are tier 1 maps (which can cause objectives to appear on tiers 1, 2 or 3) and tier 16 maps (which can cause objectives to appear on tiers 14, 15, and 16). They favour maps you have previously completed but may appear on maps not yet revealed.

When Jun unveils the modifier, you'll be presented with three different options for what that modifier will ultimately be.
